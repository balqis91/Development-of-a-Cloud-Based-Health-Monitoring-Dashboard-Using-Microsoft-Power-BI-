## Development of a Cloud-Based Health Monitoring Dashboard Using Microsoft Power BI
## Development of a Cloudbased Dashboard
## Overview
This project is all about creating an highly scalable interactive dashboard for monitoring patient health conditions  and management of the database using a `Lung Cancer` dataset for its visualisation. The idea is to show how health organisation can manage vast amount of dataset in a secure and scalable manner, while maintaining adequate projection of Patients informtion.
## Introduction
Over the years, the healthcare sector has increasingly relied on information technology to enhance services and performance. Integrating information systems has significantly improved operational efficiency, service effectiveness, and care quality. Business intelligence (BI) tools and analytics are important tools, converting data into valuable insights for better decision-making. Dashboards is useed to as a key BI component, visualize critical metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs), aiding healthcare professionals in quicker diagnoses and patient engagement. This project explores the development and application of such dashboards, highlighting their benefits and uses in healthcare, particularly for performance monitoring and health condition tracking
## Peculiarity of the Project
Several past researchers have developed dashboards for monitoring health systems. However,this study has developed this dfashboard within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) management console. These resources where provisioned in the AWS console using Terraform which is an infrastructure as a code which is owned by HashiCorps.
## Introduction to Terraform
The project improves cloud infrastructure provisioning and management using Terraform for a health monitoring dashboard. Traditional manual setup via the AWS console is inefficient for dynamic, frequently updated healthcare dashboards. Terraform, as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automates and streamlines this process, ensuring consistent deployment and management of AWS resources like VPCs, subnets, and security groups. The approach involves writing configuration files, initializing the system, planning, and applying the setup, which facilitates scalable, repeatable, and error-free deployments. This method also supports code validation, testing, and documentation, enhancing efficiency and stability in managing healthcare data systems.
